# Confluent Cloud Tools

"As a developer, you want to build applications, not infrastructure" -- this is the pilosophy behind [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud), A resilient, scalable streaming data service based on Apache Kafka -- delivered as a fully managed service. Unlike proprietary services, Confluent Cloud offers the same open-source Kafka APIs that you know and love -- giving you access to the vibrant Kafka ecosystem that includes [Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/index.html), [REST Proxy](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka-rest/docs/index.html) and [Control Center](https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/index.html).

The Confluent Cloud Tools is an open-source project based on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) that allows you to get all the tools from Confluent Platform (Schema Registry, REST Proxy, Control Center, KSQL) up-and-running in ~10 minutes. All you have to do is:

And hey... it is ~10 minutes of Cloud provisioning time instead of hard work.
