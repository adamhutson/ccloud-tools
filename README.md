# Confluent Cloud Tools

"As a developer, you want to build applications, not infrastructure" -- this is the pilosophy behind [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud), A resilient, scalable streaming data service based on Apache Kafka -- delivered as a fully managed service. Unlike proprietary services, Confluent Cloud offers the same open-source Kafka APIs that you know and love -- giving you access to the vibrant Kafka ecosystem. That include powerful tools such as [Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/docs/index.html), [REST Proxy](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka-rest/docs/index.html) and [Control Center](https://docs.confluent.io/current/control-center/index.html).

That provides you the flexibility to run these tools anywhere -- whether if it is on-premise or in any given Cloud provider. Though is not necessarily too complex to set these up by yourself -- some developers would like to set down this Ops burden and have everything up-and-running in the Cloud, using a horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant topology. And more importantly: with everything hooked up automatically with Confluent Cloud.
